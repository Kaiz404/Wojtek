                    Wojtek (1942 – 2 December 1963; Polish pronunciation: [ˈvɔjtɛk]; in English, sometimes phonetically spelled Voytek and pronounced as such) was a Syrian brown bear[1][2] (Ursus arctos syriacus) bought, as a young cub, at a railway station in Hamadan, Iran, by Polish II Corps soldiers who had been evacuated from the Soviet Union. In order to provide for his rations and transportation, he was eventually enlisted officially as a soldier with the rank of private, and was subsequently promoted to corporal

                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <p>
                    At a railroad station in Hamadan, Iran, on 8 April 1942, Polish soldiers encountered a young Iranian boy who had found a bear cub whose mother had been shot by hunters. One of the civilian refugees in their midst, eighteen-year-old Irena (Inka) Bokiewicz, the great-niece of General Bolesław Wieniawa-Długoszowski, was very taken with the cub. She prompted Lieutenant Anatol Tarnowiecki to buy the young bear, which spent the next three months in a Polish refugee camp established near Tehran, principally under Irena's care.

                <h3>Name</h3>
                <p>
                    In August, the bear was donated to the 2nd Transport Company, which later became the 22nd Artillery Supply Company, and he was named Wojtek by the soldiers. The name Wojtek is the nickname, diminutive form, or hypocorism of "Wojciech" (Happy Warrior),

                <li>He enjoyed wrestling with the soldiers and was taught to salute when greeted.</li>
                <li>Wojtek copied the other soldiers, drinking beer, smoking and even marching alongside them on his hind legs because he saw them do so. </li>

            <h3>PRIVATE WOJTEK (RANKINGS)</h3>
            <p>
                From Egypt, the Polish II Corps was reassigned to fight alongside the British Eighth Army in the Italian campaign. Regulations for the British transport ship, which was to carry them to Italy, forbade mascot and pet animals. To get around this restriction, Wojtek was officially drafted into the Polish Army as a private and listed among the soldiers of the 22nd Artillery Supply Company.
            </p>

            <h3>BATTLES, WAR EFFORTS</h3>
            <p>
                During the Battle of Monte Cassino, Wojtek helped his unit to convey ammunition by carrying 100-pound (45 kg) crates of 25-pound artillery shells, never dropping any of them.

                <li>Following demobilization on 15 November 1947, Wojtek was given to Edinburgh Zoo, where he spent the rest of his life.</li>
                <li>Former Polish soldiers, some of whom tossed cigarettes for him to eat, as he did during his time in the army.                </li>
                <li>happily responded to being spoken to in Polish, recognizing many of his former unit. </li>
                <li>Media attention contributed to Wojtek's popularity. He was a frequent guest on BBC television's Blue Peter programme for children.</li>
                <li>Some Soldiers would jump into his enclosure to keep him company much to the horror of some zoo staff.</li>
